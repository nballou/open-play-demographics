Using publicly available behavioral logs from Steam, Xbox, and Nintendo spanning 1.5 million hours from 3768 US and UK adults (18--40 years old), I present a visualization-driven descriptive analysis of how play patterns differ according to age, gender, ethnicity, and neurodiversity. Results uncover a variety of trends that have rarely been observed in public data: among others, that older players' peak playtime occurs approximately 1 hour earlier in the day, that women tend to re-engage with the same game for a longer time period, and that sports games were more popular among Black, Asian, and neurotypical players than among other ethnic groups and neurodiverse players. Despite intriguing group-level trends, however, within-group variation is far larger: demographic characteristics account for at most 5.4% of gameplay behavioral variation. This work provides an empirically grounded complement to survey research and motivates future investigation into the structural and cultural factors shaping play behavior.\nbibliography: references.bib\nkeywords:\n  - video games\n  - demographics\n  - behavioral data\n  - descriptive\n  - genres\neditor_options:\n  chunk_output_type: console\n  markdown:\n    wrap: none\nknitr:\n  opts_chunk:\n    cache: true\n    warning: false\n    message: false\n    fig-width: 6\n    fig-asp: 0.618\n    out-width: 80%\n    fig-align: center\ncode-links: repo\nformat:\n  html:\n    csl: https://www.zotero.org/styles/apa\n    theme:\n      light: united\n      dark: darkly\n    toc: true\n    toc-depth: 2\n    toc-location: right\n    number-sections: true\n    fontsize: 13pt\n    code-fold: true\n    code-summary: \"Show code\"\n    code-tools: true\n    echo: true\n    embed-resources: false\n    page-layout: article\n    grid:\n      body-width: 900px\n      margin-width: 250px\n    other-links:\n      - text: Data\n        href: https://zenodo.org/records/17609160\n        icon: link\n  preprint-typst:\n    output-file: index-typst.pdf\n    echo: false\n    wordcount: true\n    theme: jou\n    citeproc: true\n    mainfont: \"Liberation Serif\"\n    sansfont: \"Liberation Sans\"\n    include-before-body:\n      - text: \"#show <refs>: set par(hanging-indent: 1.4em)\"\n  docx:\n    echo: false\n  acm-pdf:\n    output-file: index-acm.pdf\n    format: sigconf\n    echo: false\n    keep-tex: true\n    fig-width: 3.33\n    fig-height: 2.5\n    fig-format: pdf\n    biblio-style: ACM-Reference-Format\n    include-in-header:\n      - text: |\n          \\usepackage{tabularray}\n          \\usepackage{float}\n          \\usepackage{graphicx}\n          \\usepackage{rotating}\n          \\usepackage[normalem]{ulem}\n          \\usepackage{colortbl}\n          \\usepackage{booktabs}\n          \\UseTblrLibrary{booktabs}\n    acm-metadata:\n      anonymous: true\n      copyright: none\n      copyright-year: \"2026\"\n      acm-year: \"2026\"\n      conference-acronym: \"CHI PLAY '26\"\n      conference-name: \"ACM SIGCHI Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play\"\n      conference-date: \"November 2--5, 2026\"\n      conference-location: \"York, UK\"\n      ccs: |\n        \\ccsdesc[500]{Human-centered computing~Empirical studies in HCI}\n        \\ccsdesc[300]{Human-centered computing~Empirical studies in collaborative and social computing}\n---\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n# Introduction\n\nQuestions about who plays video games and how play varies across demographic groups remain central to games research and practice. Differences in age, gender, ethnicity, and neurodiversity are routinely invoked to explain variation in genre engagement, time investment, social play, and monetization patterns, with implications for theory development, experimental design, and commercial decision-making.\n\nAt the same time, many existing claims about demographic differences in play rest on limited empirical foundations, often relying on self-report data, highly aggregated industry statistics [e.g., @EntertainmentSoftwareAssociation20252025], and/or homogenous samples [@LarrieuEtAl2023How]. Each of these practices seriously limits our understanding of the true differences in behavior among different groups. Researchers have long known that self-report media use data is often a poor reflection of actual digital behavior [e.g., @ParryEtAl2021systematic; @ChoiEtAl2023Logs; @KahnEtAl2014why]. \n\nDemographic characteristics such as age, gender, and culture are used pervasively across games research and practice, but with varying degrees of empirical grounding. In theory, demographic variables are routinely positioned as moderators of core constructs within theories related to impulse purchasing [@ZhangEtAl2021Gamification], technology acceptance [@HarnadiEtAl2025Role], social influence [@Liu2016Understanding], and game preferences [@Gonzalez-GonzalezEtAl2022Gender], among others---yet such use often treats demographics as proxies for underlying preferences or motivations without specifying the mechanisms through which they operate. In empirical practice, demographics frequently serve as key predictors of outcomes like player types [@SantosEtAl2025Relationship], esports participation [@KordyakaEtAl2023Gender], or problematic gaming [@Lopez-FernandezEtAl2019Female], but the practical significance of these associations is rarely scrutinized [@VornhagenEtAl2020Statisticala; @Kirk1996Practical]. In industry and HCI research, demographic segmentation guides decisions about targeting, content, and design for groups such as women and older players [@GerlingEtAl2012Game; @KaufmanEtAl2019Not], though segmentation based on what players' recorded behavior is often recognized as more informative [@zotero-item-16756; @YinEtAl2025Modeling]. Across all three arenas, the question of how much demographic categories actually explain about individual behavior remains largely unexamined with behavioral data outside of industry internal research.\n\nDigital trace data, defined as behavioral logs automatically collected by digital devices and online platforms, offers a complementary lens. By observing play directly, trace data sidesteps the recall bias and social desirability effects inherent in self-report, while capturing dimensions of play (such as hour-by-hour temporal patterns or engagement span across titles) that surveys cannot feasibly measure. Trace data thus enables more fine-grained descriptions of play and its demographic composition, supports better monitoring of how the characteristics and behaviors of players change over time, and improves predictions about how play and player populations are likely to evolve in the future. The present article marks one such snapshot in the form of a secondary analysis of the Open Play dataset [@BallouEtAl2025Open]---a large, multi-platform collection of behavioral logs from US and UK adults---to describe how observed play patterns vary across age, gender, ethnicity, and neurodiversity. \n\n<!-- [@BallouEtAl2025Open] -->\n\nIn sum, demographic differences are treated as theoretically and practically important, yet the behavioral evidence used to motivate those claims is frequently indirect or coarse. To address this gap, I adopt a descriptive, visualization-first approach that foregrounds both between-group patterns and within-group heterogeneity. I do not conduct null hypothesis significance testing; instead, I focus on the magnitude and structure of observed differences. The work makes two primary contributions:\n\n- It provides a behaviorally grounded descriptive map of play variation across age, gender, ethnicity, and neurodiversity using observed play histories rather than self-report alone.\n- It foregrounds (and quantifies) within-group heterogeneity and distributional overlap, challenging monolithic representations of demographic groups.\n\n# Related Work \n\n## Who plays games?\n\nFrequent reports, often industry-led, document the changing demographics of people who play games. In the US, players are now almost equally split by gender, are slightly more likely to be white compared to national averages, and 28% are over age 50 [@EntertainmentSoftwareAssociation20252025], illustrating the durability of gaming across the lifespan. Among teenagers, the demographics most likely to play are early adolescents (13–14), boys, Black youth, and those from lower-income households [@GottfriedSidoti2024Teens]. Among US adolescents with mental health difficulties, gaming was relatively popular among Black females and Asian males [@CarsonEtAl2012Racial].\n\nThese contemporary findings contrast with early work characterizing video game players as predominantly male, competitive, and academically high-performing [@McClureMears1984Video; @McClure1985Age], a portrait that reflected both the demographics of early gaming and the narrow samples used to study them. More recent work has demonstrated the value of large-scale open data for illuminating within- and between-group heterogeneity, as in the case of board game preferences [@CrossEtAl2023Your].\n\n## How do demographic characteristics relate to play behavior? \n\nEqually interesting is not who plays games at all, but how, among video game players, subgroups differ. Complementing a large body of work on player types and motivations [@Yee2006motivations; @HughesCairns2020Player], a range of studies have examined how demographic characteristics relate to specific dimensions of play.\n\nWith regard to genre preferences, survey research has found that male gamers are more likely to play Strategy, Role Playing, Action, and Fighting genres, whereas female gamers are more likely to play Social, Puzzle/Card, Music/Dance, and Simulation games [@PhanEtAl2012Examining; @TondelloNacke2019player]. Industry data similarly indicate that older players (Gen X and above) gravitate toward 'Skill & Chance' games and away from action titles, compared to younger cohorts [@EntertainmentSoftwareAssociation20252025]. Age, gender, and education level have also been weakly linked to player type archetypes such as \"achiever\" and \"disrupter,\" though they appear unrelated to self-reported play frequency [@SantosEtAl2025Relationship].\n\nPlatform choice also varies: teenage boys are more likely to play on console, while smartphones and tablets make up a larger share of teenage girls' play [@GottfriedSidoti2024Teens]. Lower socio-economic status has been associated with greater preference for sports games [@Andrews2008Gameplay].\n\nStudies of neurodiverse players have found a preference for RPGs among adults with autism [@MazurekEtAl2015Video], as well as  higher motivations escapism, completionism, and customisation [@MillingtonEtAl2022Brief]. Adolescents with ADHD tend to have higher playtime and problematic gaming [@IsornaFolgarEtAl2024Evaluation]. However, researchers have criticized the games HCI literature on neurodiversity for being prescriptive or focusing on \"cures\" rather than understanding the diversity of play experiences and preferences among neurodiverse players, and specifically call for more comparisons between neurotypical and neurodiverse behavioral patterns [@SpielGerling2021Purpose].\n\nA smaller number of studies have used behavioral trace data rather than self-report, and their findings sometimes diverge from survey-based accounts. Early analyses of EverQuest II trace data found that playtime did not differ by ethnic background, religious affiliation, or income [@WilliamsEtAl2008Who], but that women played approximately 15% more hours per week than men, were more motivated by social factors, and were more likely to under-report their playtime relative to logged data [@WilliamsEtAl2009Looking]. An analysis of League of Legends data showed that women had fewer matches played but accrued skill at the same rate, and were more likely to play support roles [@RatanEtAl2015Stand]. Beyond games, analyses of time-use diaries have shown that time spent playing video games is highly sensitive to total available leisure time for younger men, but not for younger women or older men [@AguiarEtAl2017Leisure].\n\nTaken together, the existing literature provides a partial but fragmented picture. Most findings derive from single platforms or single games, rely on self-report, or lack demographic diversity. The present study aims to complement this body of work by examining demographic variation in play across multiple platforms using observed behavioral data from a diverse sample, and by quantifying how much heterogeneity in play patterns is accounted for within vs between groups.\n\n## Present Study\n\nThe present study thus attempts to improve the field's understanding of demographic differences in play behavior by leveraging the Open Play dataset [@BallouEtAl2025Open]. The Open Play dataset is a publicly available dataset of 3,768 US and UK 18-40 year olds who contributed digital trace data from five gaming platforms (Xbox, Nintendo Switch, Steam, iOS and Android), who were screened using quasi-representative methods (with partial quotas for age, gender, and ethnicity). Analyses are guided by two research questions: \n\n*RQ1:* How do the volume, composition, and temporal distribution of observed play vary across age, gender, ethnicity, and neurodiversity in this dataset?\n\n*RQ2:* How much of the total variation in play behavior is attributable to between-group demographic differences versus within-group individual differences?\n\nIt is vital to be clear about what the study does not aim to do. Results here should be treated as pattern discovery and fodder for hypothesis generation, rather than population inference. I do not conduct statistical tests, and the present dataset is not fully representative of the general population (who vary tremendously in their propensity to play games) nor of the gaming population (whose demographics remain only loosely understood, and who themselves vary in willingness to participate or share data). Nonetheless, the diversity present in the sample and the breadth of trace data allows for a more detailed look at naturalistic gaming behavior than available in many contemporary studies. Further, the data do not support claims of inherent preferences, or shed light on mechanisms---observed behavioral patterns may reflect structural, cultural, platform-level, or other factors. \n\n# Method\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\nThe data for this study comprise a subset of the data from the Open Play study [@BallouEtAl2025Open], version 1.1.0. In that study, participants provided access to automated records of their gaming history on one or more platforms (Xbox, Steam, Nintendo Switch, iOS, Android; Xbox is included for US participants only) and completed an intake survey followed by daily and biweekly surveys. The present study uses only the digital trace data from console and PC and demographic data from the intake survey, and does not include daily or biweekly survey data or mobile data (due to lower granularity compared to other trace data streams). Intake surveys were completed between Sep 2024 and Jan 2026. Digital trace data span the following periods: Nintendo (May 2022 to Oct 2025), Steam (Nov 2024 to Oct 2025), Xbox (Apr 2022 to Sep 2025).\n\nParticipants were recruited in collaboration with two panel providers, Prolific and PureProfile. Participants were eligible if they were aged 18 or older, resided in the United States or United Kingdom, self-reported playing video games for at least 1 hour per week with at least 50% of their play happening on eligible platforms (Nintendo, Xbox, and Steam), and successfully linked at least one gaming account on Xbox, Steam, and/or Nintendo Switch with validated recent digital trace data. \n\nThe procedure for linking gameplay data differed per platform: Steam was collected through a custom platform developed for research purposes, while Xbox and Nintendo data were collected via non-financial data-sharing agreements with the platform owners. An overview of the procedure from the participant perspective is shown in Appendix @tbl-platforms, while full details of the recruitment procedures and study methodology are available in [@BallouEtAl2025Open].\n\nAll data and analysis code are available on [repository link removed for anonymous review; anonymized supplementary materials uploaded to PCS].\n<!-- Zenodo ({{< meta data-url >}}). -->\n\n## Participants\n\nA description of the sample is shown in @tbl-participants. \n\nParticipants in the initial screening sample were quasi-representative; quotas ensured that those screened were approximately nationally representative according to age, gender, and ethnicity. However, the analytic sample is non-representative, as both prevalence of gaming (i.e., likelihood of qualifying for the study) and willingness to participate in the intensive study differed across demographic groups in the screening sample. Nonetheless, the analytic sample consists of a diverse sample across gender and ethnicity. \n\nParticularly noteworthy is the neurodiversity of the sample: 23.8% of participants reported having an ADHD diagnosis, and 16.8% of participants reported having an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis (with 7.4% reporting both)---both far above national averages [see e.g., estimates that 6.0% of US adults have ADHD @StaleyEtAl2024AttentionDeficit; and 2.2% of US adults have autism @DietzEtAl2020National]. While such a high prevalence creates challenges for the generalizability of full-sample analyses, having this degree of diversity present in the sample allows for a more nuanced look at how play patterns vary across different neurotypes, rather than treating neurodivergent players as a monolithic group.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-participants .cell layout-align=\"center\" tbl-cap='Participant characteristics by country'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{table}\n\\centering\n\\begin{talltblr}[         %% tabularray outer open\nentry=none,label=none,\nnote{}={Values are M (SD) or N (percent).

Because the multivariate visualizations used here (e.g., radar charts comparing genre profiles) require categorical groupings, continuous age is binned into four groups (18–24, 25–30, 31–35, 36–40) for comparability with the other demographic dimensions.\n\n*Gender*: Participants selected from the following options: Woman, Man, Non-binary, Prefer to specify, and Prefer not to say. For simplicity, \"non-binary\" and \"prefer to specify\" were recoded as \"Non-binary/other\".\n\n*Ethnicity*: Response options were drawn from primary census categories in each respective country. US participants selected between White alone; Black or African American alone; American Indian and Alaska Native alone; Asian alone; Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone; Some Other Race alone; and Two or More Races. UK participants selected among White; Mixed or multiple ethnic groups; Asian or Asian British; Black, African, Caribbean or Black British; Other ethnic group; Prefer not to say. For simplicity, I harmonized these categories into a smaller set of labels (e.g., \"Black or African American alone\" and \"Black, African, Caribbean or Black British\" were both recoded as \"Black\").\n\n*Neurodiversity*: Participants were asked if they had received a formal diagnosis of neurodiverse conditions from a qualified healthcare professional; if they selected yes, they were provided a list of 12 options. In this paper, I focus solely on players who reported having a diagnosis of either autism spectrum disorder or attention deficit hyperactive disorder, as prevalence of other categories (e.g., dyscalculia) was too small for meaningful analysis. \n\n### Gaming behavior variables\n\n*Gaming behavior* on Xbox, Steam, and Nintendo Switch was measured via a mix of (a) session-level data provided by Nintendo of America, Nintendo of Europe, and Microsoft; and (b) hourly playtime collected using open source methods built on the Steam API. The exact data-sharing procedure and data collected varied by platform; details are available in Appendix @tbl-platforms, and are described in exhaustive detail in @BallouEtAl2025Open.\n\nBecause Xbox titles are replaced with a random identifier instead of the specific game, subsequent analyses in this paper do not focus on particular games, but rather on genres (as this metadata was provided alongside Xbox games). For reference, the most popular 5 non-Xbox games for each demographic group are shown in @tbl-top-games\n\nFrom the hourly and session-level data, I calculated various summary variables including: total playtime (hours), session count, mean session duration, genre categories (how assigned to titles), title diversity, and hour of day and day of week distributions. These derived variables form the basis of the descriptions to come. \n\n### Genres\n\nNintendo and Steam data contain full game titles; to collect game metadata including genres, we used the Internet Games Database (IGDB) API. Xbox data was provided using random identifiers in place of game titles, but with genre labels as seen on the Xbox store. For simplicity, I therefore harmonized IGDB and Xbox genres into a smaller subset of categories (e.g., turn-based strategy, real-time strategy, tactical, MOBA were collapsed into a single \"Strategy\" category). Full details of the genre mapping are available in the supplementary materials. For the primary genre analysis, each game was assigned to its first listed genre, typically the primary genre; a supplementary multi-genre analysis (Appendix @fig-genre-radar-multi) apportioned playtime equally across all genres a game was tagged with and largely replicated the findings.\n\n### Ethics\n\nThis study received ethical approval from [redacted for anonymous peer review]. All participants provided informed consent at the start of the study, including consent to their data being shared openly for reanalysis. \n\n<!-- Social Sciences and Humanities Inter-Divisional Research Ethics Committee at the University of Oxford (OII_CIA_23_107). -->\n\nParticipants were paid at an average rate of £12/hour, equating to: £0.20 for a 1-minute screening, £2 for the 10-minute intake survey (plus £5 for linking at least one account with recent data), £0.80 for each 4-minute daily survey. Participants received a £10 bonus payment for completing at least 24 out of 30 daily surveys.\n\n# Results\n\nResults below first depict the behavioral patterns observed in play volume, engagement patterns and temporal organization, and genre composition, before quantifying total explanatory power.\n\n## Play volume across demographic groups\n\n::: {.place arguments='top, scope: \"parent\", float: true'}\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Distribution of play volume metrics across demographic groups.

There is a small observed difference in the total number of sessions played by participants with ADHD compared to neurotypical players (169 vs 128), but no difference in median session duration (31 vs 31 minutes). Asian players in the sample had slightly lower playtime and sessions than other ethnic groups.\n\n::: {.place arguments='top, scope: \"parent\", float: true'}\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Game-level engagement across demographic groups: median hours invested per sticky game (played on 2+ days) vs. median calendar span of engagement.

Black and women players tend to spread their engagement out over a longer period, with a typical game being played for approximately 50 days, whereas men and most other groups tend to play a game between 29 and 40 days.  \n\n## Temporal patterns across demographic groups\n\n::: {.place arguments='top, scope: \"parent\", float: true'}\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Temporal patterns of play across demographic groups.

I further calculated the proportion of playtime taking place on weekdays vs weekends, and the percentage of play that takes place during a given person's top 3 hours. The latter constitutes an index of play routine and stability (for example, someone plays exclusively between 6--9pm would have a value of 100%, whereas someone who plays equally throughout the 24-hour would have a value of 3/24 = 12.5%). \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\nResults (@fig-temporal, Panel A) show that 18--35 year olds have similar play patterns, with 9pm being the peak gaming hour. Playtime among 36-40 year-olds shifts slightly earlier, peaking at 8pm.\n\n@fig-temporal Panel B shows routine and weekend concentration for each demographic group. In the present sample, older players concentrated their play on weekends more than younger groups (30.5% of play taking place on weekends for 18--24 year olds vs 34.5% for 36--40 year olds) and had more fixed routines (33.5% of 18--24 year olds' play took place within their top 3 hours, compared to 36.9% for 36--40 year olds). Among ethnic backgrounds, Asian players had the most stable play routines, whereas Black players were least concentrated in consistent times of day (30.4% of playtime falling in the top 3 hours for Black players, 37.2% for Asian players).\n\n## Genre composition across demographic groups\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.place arguments='top, scope: \"parent\", float: true'}\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Genre playtime profiles across demographic groups (primary genre only).

Each demographic group is a radar; the grey circle represents average genre allocation for all other groups (i.e., for 18-24 year olds, the grey line represents the average genre allocation across all age groups, 25--40). The outer dashed line represents 200% of that average, and the inner dashed ring represents 50%. Points farther from the center therefore indicate that this genre is relatively popular among that demographic group, whereas points closer to the center indicate that the genre is relatively unpopular. \n\nA wide variety of observed differences emerge. Among other differences, results in the present sample align with well-documented preferences among men for sports games, and among women for puzzle and simulation games. Asian players in the sample played relatively high amounts of racing, platform, and sports games, whereas White players played slightly more puzzle games than other ethnic groups. Neurodiverse players had slight preference for RPGs compared to neurotypical players, who played more racing games. \n\n### Intersectional genre patterns\n\n::: {.place arguments='top, scope: \"parent\", float: true'}\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Genre preference profiles across intersectional demographic groups.

For example, the preference among women for puzzle games was particularly strong among 25--30 White woman, both neurodiverse and neurotypical, while the preference for strategy games was strongest in the 18-24 neurotypical Asian men group. Intersectional results should be interpreted with caution, due to the smaller sample sizes within each intersection and the inherent idiosyncrasies of the full sample.\n\n## Variance decomposition\n\nThe preceding analyses reveal differences in central tendency across demographic groups, but these visualizations can obscure how much of the total variation in play behavior lies between groups versus within groups. If between-group variance is small relative to within-group variance, demographic categories explain little of the overall heterogeneity in how people play—even if group means differ noticeably. \n\nTo quantify how much of the variation in play behavior is attributable to demographic categories versus individual differences, I calculated the proportion of total variance in an outcome that lies between groups rather than within groups, computed as `SS_between / SS_total`. For the combined estimate, I fit a multiple linear regression predicting each outcome from all four demographic variables simultaneously (age group, gender, ethnicity, and neurodiversity) and extracted $R^2$, which represents the total variance explained by the full demographic profile. Values near zero indicate that demographic categories explain little of the overall heterogeneity in play behavior, even when group means differ noticeably. \n\n\n::: {#tbl-variance-decomposition .cell layout-align=\"center\" tbl-cap='Proportion of variance explained by demographic categories (eta-squared).

Demographic categories explain less than 3% of total variance in every case, with most values below 1%. Even in a more parameterized specification with flexible age effects and all two-way interactions, the maximum variance explained was 5.4%. \n\nIn short, individuals within the same demographic group differ from one another far more than group averages differ from each other. This pattern holds across volume, composition, and temporal outcomes, reinforcing that demographic labels capture only a small slice of the heterogeneity in how people play.\n\n# Discussion\n\nThe results presented here show a variety of trends among demographic groups in a diverse sample of UK and US adult video game players. Many these have been documented in prior survey-based research, such as the prevalence of sports game play among men and simulation game play among women [@PhanEtAl2012Examining] or the preference for RPGs among adults with autism [@MazurekEtAl2015Video]. Other patterns are intuitive and have been theorized, but rarely directly observed and quantified in naturalistic behavioral data, such as the 1 hour earlier peak time and higher weekend concentration for older players [@ReamEtAl2013Trends].\n\nHowever, despite the presence of these trends, the overall picture is one of substantial heterogeneity within groups, and thus overlap between them. For every observed difference, there are many individuals in the \"opposite\" group who show the same behavior. For example, although there is a marked difference in the average proportion of time men and women in the sample spent playing games in the shooter genre (33% vs 24.4% on average), there are still 208 (17%) women who have a higher shooter proportion than the average man. Results showing that effectively all permutations of play volume, timing and genre allocation are present in all demographic groups serves as a form of counter-stereotypical examples, a method recommended for reducing and reversing implicit biases in games culture [@FlanaganKaufman2017Shifting]. \n\nIn other words: while trends emerge at a bird's eye view, knowing an individual's complete demographic profile tells us remarkably little about their actual play behavior. Even with all demographic variables combined, a researcher could explain at most 5.4% of the variance in any single play outcome (@tbl-variance-decomposition). These findings echo early trace data studies showing demographic categories explain minimal variance in play patterns [@WilliamsEtAl2008Who], but extend them to contemporary multi-platform contexts and provide explicit variance decomposition. \n\nIt is vital to interpret these results with care, and to avoid overgeneralization or stereotyping. The observed differences do not necessarily reflect stable preferences or inherent traits of demographic groups, but rather patterns of behavior that emerge from a complex interplay of structural factors, cultural contexts, and individual circumstances. For example, differences in temporal play patterns may reflect differences in work schedules [e.g., @LeeChen2023Seeking], caregiving responsibilities [e.g., @WangEtAl2018Families], accessibility concerns [@PorterKientz2013empirical], or availability of gaming platforms [e.g., @HaKim2024Barriers], rather than intrinsic preferences for when to play. Similarly, genre preferences may be shaped by factors such as marketing, social norms, or peer influence, rather than inherent tastes. For example, it is long-established that White adult male characters are over-represented among video game characters, while Black female characters and many other groups are under-represented [@WilliamsEtAl2009virtual; @JonesEtAl2025virtual; cf. @GardnerTanenbaum2018Dynamic], which may contribute to the observed differences in genre allocation.\n\nWith those caveats in mind, this work still offers several contributions for the field: it offers a foundation for hypothesis generation, theory specification, and study design; highlights behavioral dimensions such as routine concentration or genre diversity that may be more informative outcomes than total playtime; and points to the value of behavioral trace data in revealing how people actually play, rather than what they say about their play.\n\n## Implications for the Use of Demographic Variables\n\nThese findings complicate how demographic categories should function in games HCI theory. When within-group variance is at least 18x larger than between-group variance, demographics may be valuable as contextual background variables but are unlikely to be useful as primary predictors of behavioral outcomes. Such empirical backing reinforces known challenges for theory, quantitative methods, and design.\n\nOn the theory side, I argue for improved specification of the specific *mechanisms* through which demographics matter rather than treating them as proxies for preferences. Although there is widespread recognition of the pitfalls of demographic essentialism at the theory level, empirical studies often use and interpret demographics are key predictors of outcomes such as motivational styles or player types [@Yee2006motivations], esports participation [@KordyakaEtAl2023Gender], or internet gaming disorder [@Lopez-FernandezEtAl2019Female]. Such use of demographic variables may serve as a proxy for preferences or behaviors, masking the underlying mechanistic differences on which the field could actually intervene. Future work with representative samples and/or qualitative methods can help unpack which of these trends generalize to other metrics of real-world play, and why they occur (access? cultural exposure? time constraints?).\n\nEventually, such work may allow mechanism-related variables to supplement demographics themselves in quantitative studies. Results here show that the use of demographics variables in statistical models should be carefully considered. Researchers should report and be mindful of effect sizes, and ensure that statistical significance of a particular demographic variable is not conflated with the practical significance thereof [@Kirk1996Practical; @VornhagenEtAl2020Statisticala].\n\nWith regard to design, these results suggest that demographic categories may be useful for coarse segmentation, but heterogeneity will often be too large to reliably base more granular decisions such as design for diverse groups such as women or older players [@GerlingEtAl2012Game; @KaufmanEtAl2019Not]. Behavioral segmentation based on characteristics like genre allocation and temporal play patterns, a well-established industry practice [@YinEtAl2025Modeling; @zotero-item-16756], offers a valuable alternative for many design or intervention decisions. \n\nTo reiterate, low predictive strength does not mean demographics have no value for design or analytics. Observed differences in temporal organization and engagement span suggest that features such as session length expectations, save mechanics, or live-service timing may differentially fit players with distinct demographic constraints (@fig-temporal). Similarly, genre portfolio patterns can inform decisions about cross-promotion, onboarding pathways, and content diversification strategies.\n\n## Limitations, Generalizability, and Future Directions\n\nAs highlighted throughout this piece, these data do not provide strong evidence for generalizable differences between groups. I did not apply weighting or conduct hypothesis tests. Observed differences should not be interpreted as stable preferences or group traits, as these data cannot meaningfully distinguish access effects from preference effects. \n\nThe gameplay behavior observed here is wide but shallow - while the data captured individuals' play across a wide variety of titles (mean: 19.6 distinct titles per player), it does not capture their behavior within particular games. To advance knowledge on various topics typically studied using self-reports or in lab settings, deep game-level is needed instead: for example, avatar selection data to study the Proteus Effect [@YeeBailenson2007Proteus], performance data to study skill acquisition [@RatanEtAl2015Stand], and communications and friends data to understand gender differences in social behavior [@Wilhelm2018Gender]. Achieving such advances will require more widespread adoption of the full trace data collection toolkit, ranging from data donation [which has already proven successful for behavioral research on social media, e.g., @YapEtAl2024Digital; @EsNguyen2025BingeWatching], scraping-based methods [@BallouEtAl2024Registered], and existing APIs [e.g., @VuorreEtAl2021largescale; although see @DavidsonEtAl2023Platformcontrolled for transparency issues associated with platform-provided APIs]. \n\nFurther, while the quasi-representative sampling strategy underlying this data produced a sample more diverse than many comparable studies of video game trace data [e.g., @BallouEtAl2024Registered; @LarrieuEtAl2023How], the sample here is not random or representative of either the general population or of all video game players. Such trade-offs are inherent: with the exception of extremely rare studies that have access to population data via platform owners [e.g., @ZendleEtAl2023Crosscultural], collecting demographic data requires contacting individual participants who may elect not to join the study. Selection biases are thus present with regard to willingness to share data, sufficient gaming on included platforms, and participation in the survey platforms from which recruitment took place (Prolific, PureProfile). \n\nI particularly draw attention to the exclusion of mobile gaming due to insufficient data granularity, as previous results have shown that the demographics of mobile players systematically differ from those of other gaming platforms [@EntertainmentSoftwareAssociation20252025; @GottfriedSidoti2024Teens]. Similarly, the lack of Xbox data among UK participants means recorded behavior and game composition differs across countries ; to mitigate this, the analyses intentionally do not compare the US and UK, but group all participants. The combination of selection biases present in the study also likely contributed to some of the surprising characteristics of the sample, such as high self-reported rates of neurodiversity. \n\nIn short, more representative or targeted samples, deep game-level data, and qualitative follow-up are all needed to build on this work. Future research should aim to disentangle access effects from preference effects, assess the generalizability of these patterns, and further unpack the lived experiences underlying observed demographic differences.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThis study used publicly available behavioral trace data from Steam, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch to describe how play patterns vary across age, gender, ethnicity, and neurodiversity in a diverse sample of 3,768 US and UK adults. Results revealed a range of demographic differences in play volume, temporal organization, engagement span, and genre composition, many of which corroborate prior survey-based findings, while others (such as the earlier peak playtime among older players or the longer engagement spans among women and Black players) have rarely been directly observed in naturalistic data. \n\nYet the overarching finding is one of within-group heterogeneity: demographic characteristics collectively explained less than 6% of the variance in any dimension of play behavior examined. These results suggest that while demographic categories remain useful for coarse description and hypothesis generation, they are poor proxies for how any individual actually plays. Future work should aim to move beyond demographics as default predictors, instead investigating the structural, cultural, and individual-level mechanisms that give rise to the patterns observed here, and doing so with representative samples, deep game-level data, and methods that center players' own accounts of their play.\n\n# Data Availability\n\n[Redacted for anonymous peer review]\n\n<!-- Data and analysis code are available on Zenodo: {{< meta data-url >}} -->\n\n# Funding\n\n[Redacted for anonymous peer review]\n\n<!-- Primary data collection was supported by the UK Economic and Social Research Council (ES/W012626/1 and ES/Y010736/1).
